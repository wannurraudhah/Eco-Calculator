# Eco-Calculator Project
  In this project, we have developed an Eco-Calculator that calculates each student's contribution score, emphasizing the goals of Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12).

  The Eco-Calculator receives data such as the amount of kilograms for each type of recyclable item, utility bills, and the frequency with which students recycle.

  Each week, the Eco-Calculator will present motivational words and calculate the contribution scores for each student. This allows students to understand their performance in recycling and how effectively they are contributing to SDG 12.

  This project also highlights key concepts in C++ programming, including association, aggregation, composition, inheritance, and polymorphism. Through the development of the Eco-Calculator, students gain practical experience in implementing these fundamental object-oriented programming principles.
